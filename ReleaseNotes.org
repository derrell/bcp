#+STARTUP: showeverything
* High-level list of changes
** Bug fixes
** Feature changes
*** On the Client detail page, there is a new checkbox, below "Verified", that says "Require new USDA signature". Checking this box and then Save will force a new signature to be obtained on the Greeter page.
*** Pop-up confirmations on the Greeter page use a larger font, so they are easier to read.
*** Cancel, Not Eligible, Paper Signature, and Clear buttons all use a large font (the same size as Save, but not bold like Save), so they are easier to read.

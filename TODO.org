*** From Taryn:
    I asked Kim about the food part of the database. Kim would use the
database if it could calculate. She'd like there to be columns for
price, weight, and one for notes. She'd want to be able to indicate
specific foods that don't show up every month that should be ordered
if available. She would use it so that she has her process written
down in the database so that it's there if shes not available. She
would also use it to be able to budget what food will cost for a month
or a year, and she'd also like to be able to report how much a certain
food has cost over the course of a year. None of this has any urgency
